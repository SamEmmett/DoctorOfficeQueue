This is a program that I made for my term project. It was supposed to be a group project, but it ended up being me programming the whole thing with zero input from my team while I also juggled finals.

Let's get this out of the way. Yes, my code is pretty rough. Going back I would have liked to use a custom PriorityQueue object and to remove the Statics in the Runner class.

The reality is that this is a group project that I was left to do all of the coding and troubleshooting.

Over the course of the two weeks that this project took place I:
    1. Learned about the BinaryHeap and how it functioned
    2. Taught myself about the operations of a PriorityQueue
    2. Coded, troubleshot, and problem solved
    3. Made the powerpoint presentation for my group that we needed to present on the due date
    4. Educated my team on BinaryHeap and PriorityQueue
    
  While this project is not my best work, I still find myself feeling proud of it. I managed to do what was, at the time, my biggest project while simultaneously juggling finals.
